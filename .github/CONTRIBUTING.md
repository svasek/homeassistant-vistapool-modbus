## Before You Start

- Please open an issue first via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/svasek/homeassistant-vistapool-modbus/issues/new/choose)  
  â†’ This allows discussion of the change, validation of the idea, and agreement on the scope before coding.
- All pull requests should relate to an existing issue.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- âœ… Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
- âœ… Keep pull requests focused and minimal â€” avoid combining unrelated changes.

## Code Style

- Python code should follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) where applicable.
- Use clear and consistent docstrings to explain functions or classes.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness â€” readable code is maintainable code.
